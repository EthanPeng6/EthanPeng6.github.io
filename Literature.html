    "A Meaningful Semester" - Ethan Peng
<section>
    Hartmut von Hentig once said that in order to be a proficient educator, he must “ensure, according to [his] power,
    that the next generation will find a world worthwhile to live in, and where the inherited burdens and difficulties
    will not crush ideas, hopes, and forces”. I sat at my designated table along with many other classmates, and there,
    we were like mannequins, waiting stiffly for the arrival of our teacher as she went for a long, torturous washroom
    break. We were aware that it was a minute before school ended and the teacher still held us hostage. Suddenly, the
    bell rang; it was time to go home. However, none of us moved. We knew that if we moved the second our English
    teacher came in, the consequences would only greet us ever so calmly and relaxed. 5 minutes passed, then 10 minutes.
    We were still there obediently waiting, as the tumultuous noise of other classes rushing out of school pulverized
    each of us. In the meantime, I had the quote resonating in my mind and imagined what other dramatization she would
    perform in our class this time around. And, with no anticipation needed, this is the story of my worst semester at
    my elementary school.

    The next moment, while everyone was still agonized and tortured by the desperation of escaping this dungeon, a loud
    noise came from the entrance; it was the teacher. She swung the door open and arrogantly walked into the classroom
    and scanned her merciless eyes across the classroom. At that second, we all stiffened, like hopeless little knights
    ready to be barbequed by a dragon. After her full counterclockwise rotation, making eye-contact with each and every
    one of our ominous eyes, she finally relaxed, amused with our helpless faces. Her standards of teaching were unlike
    any others. She would make us swear on an oath after every session so that we were, according to her, well
    “disciplinary students”. The oath went something like this:

    “Number 1: Courtesy
    Number 2: Integrity
    Number 3: Perseverance
    Number 4 Self Control
    Number 5: Humility Ma’am!”

    And like this, after each class she would order us to put our heads down so that we could catch our breaths after
    the exhausting day at school; however, she was plainly doing it to her own amusement. We would even have to speak
    with a loud and confident voice when pronouncing the rules, never forgetting the “Ma’am” at the tail-end of it.
    Additionally, the most ridiculous part was that most of our parents agreed that it was a meaningful way of ending
    the class, meaning that we had no source of sympathy. Days zoomed passed rapidly, and we were there a unified group,
    succumbed to repeating the oath over and over again.

    Whenever I think back on this lovely teacher, a portrait of German pedagogue, Hartmut von Hentig would always
    materialize and dominate my flow of thoughts. He introduced the Socratic oath, which would significantly outweigh
    that of my former English teacher’s “oath”. The discrepancy can easily be seen when we pull anyone of his quotes:
    “to respect and to defend against anyone the uniqueness of each child”. When we take a step back, you notice that a
    mirroring force is implemented against my English teacher. The fact that she makes students put their head down with
    their arms above their heads like culprits repeating a monotonous chant deforms our uniqueness, making us a unified
    group of monocolored ducks quacking “don’t touch my ducklings!”.

    Take another rule that Hentig decreed himself: “to protect him, where he is weak, to support him, where it is
    needed, in overcoming fear and guilt, malice and falsehood, doubts and mistrust and sniveling self-help addiction”.
    Truly, my teacher wasn’t a big fan of Hentig, and decided to follow her own teaching practices and implementing them
    on her students. It wasn’t very effective.

    You’re probably wondering if she got fired or not and my answer is no, I switched schools. However, it doesn’t mean
    that my experience at my previous school wasn’t a meaningful one. Through my many interactions with her teachings
    and repetitive tone wondering why we haven’t started chanting at the end of the class only immortalized our
    relationship. And sadly, that relationship had to be forcefully put an end to by my leaving. If you haven’t felt my
    sarcasm yet, a note goes to you that being hauled around taking pointless oaths might not be the most effective way
    of teaching. Hartmut von Hentig once said, “to make aware of his and her emotions, to listen to him and her, to take
    him and her seriously”.

    "The Message" - Ethan Peng
</p>
<section>
    Like a star in the night sky, she walked right past me, creating an overbearing contrast between the two of us. The
    chasm profoundly made my entirety seem puny and monocolored as if I was a puddle that was once melted by fire. The
    fragrance of her hair whipped me like a tide and stung my face when she walked by. I was just about to whine about
    how lethal her hair was until when I turned around and saw the majestic form in which she walked. That was when the
    stinging ceased and was replaced by a pair of wistful eyes staring upon goals that only distanced further, and
    further. We were close friends, so I approached her and tapped her on her left shoulder and she chased me all around
    the school. When we covered the distance of the whole school campus, we were exhausted and decided to sit down under
    a tree in the playground. We were like a couple. This was the life I desired for, to be so intimate with her.
    Suddenly, she raised her head towards mine and whispered something into my right ear...

    Unfortunately, that did not happen. I woke up to the hammering of my alarm, confused about my surroundings. A trace
    of her face flashed in my head in remembrance as I turned and realized that she was not there anymore. I looked in
    every corner and every room of the house, looking for the lost cat that was once supposed to be mine. Was it then
    that I realized that everything was only a dream.

    I was so dreadful that I pulled out my phone and began to rummage through the chat history between her and me and
    realized that we barely ever talked. I wanted to ask her out badly, so I typed a few words onto the text bar that
    read “will you go out with me?” and hesitated before sending it. “What if she rejects me?” “What if we can’t even be
    friends anymore after I sent this?”. My fingers immediately began to move to find the delete key but accidentally
    pressed on the enter key. A warm chill quickly gathered inside my cheeks as my face soon became a tomato. I swiftly
    pressed on the sent message and thirsted for the un-send button. As soon as I found it and the message was unsent, I
    closed my phone, hoping that she didn’t see anything.

    After breakfast, it was time to go to school. I couldn’t count how many times I saw or walked past her. We were like
    strangers. I wasn’t that outgoing, or approachable guy anymore. I wasn’t that guy who let her chase me all around
    the school anymore. I was only a self-conscious, and shy boy who wouldn’t speak up in class with her presence there
    and didn’t even dare to work effectively in group projects with her. It was her, that made me feel unworthy. It was
    her, that drained the ego from me. Her beauty only contributed more to the burden that kept me from being socially
    active towards her. I was determined, determined to accumulate all of the confidence to even just speak one word
    with her.

    It was a total disaster. I approached her and began blabbering all of this nonsense to her. It went something like
    this:

    “He-hey there ho-how is y-your d-day go-ing so far?”

    “I like your new gl-glasses. Wait, I mean hair, no, I mean hair color!”

    How wonderful that conversation went. It ended with me shamefully retreating under my lonely raincloud, her awkward
    demeanor making a scar in my mind.

    Something about her appearance made me feel uncomfortable, and uneasy when next to her. It made my entire script of
    pick-up lines foggy, making me unable to read off of my set of sentences prepared just for her. Something told me to
    give up, to stop wasting my time on unrealistic objectives. But deep inside me said to never give up, even when life
    gives you lemons; you make lemonade. Though it might sound cliche, that was the particular force that dragged me
    towards becoming closer with her. However, in that particular moment, the devil side of me overcame me and the
    sudden realization that she was longed by many, and had already several potential subjects–much better than me–made
    me finally put her down, and I continued with whatever I was doing.

    I was scrolling through my images the next morning and stumbled across a photo of me and my friends during a
    birthday party. It was a good photo. I saw myself with my arms wrapped around two of my best friends with her right
    below us. Oh, how I regret saying it was a good photo! It was a magnificent photo at least! The beauty filters that
    highlighted her face colors and added a touch of sparkles to her big eyes emphasized how well-proportioned her face
    was. The waviness of her hair rushed down her sides like a waterfall. Her pointed nose fitted so well with her full
    lips and round eyes, enchanting her whole figure and made the other girls in the photo insignificant. I zoomed in
    closely to admire her for a few more minutes and suddenly, a gush of confidence rose to my chest and my entire
    figure became more arrogant. I was ready.

    My self-consciousness overcame me at last and I decided not to ask her out. It was then till I realized that I had
    one unread message on my phone, it was from her. I unlocked my phone and saw a “yes” under our untouched message
    history. I was confused at first, but suddenly knew everything, everything that that one word encompassed - she saw
    the message.

    "Illusion" - Ethan Peng
</p>
<section>
    He sped through the branches, each one slicing a wound. He could hear the whispers and growls of the red eyes
    surrounding him, staring, in the blackness of space. The thing behind him was approaching closer, and closer. Each
    half-mile he ran was a step of the monstrous thing behind him. He could hear his heartbeat over the ground-cracking
    thuds. Suddenly, the ground before him split as the monster laid another foot. He was at the edge of the crack and
    screamed as he lost his balance. He fell in a ninety degree angle and his hands grasped to the edge of the other
    ground. He was now parallel to the ground beneath him and he spied the honed spikes beneath him waiting. Piercing
    lights shone from the spike tip that could blind anyone. He was so focused on not falling to his death that he
    forgot about the creature. He panicked. He struggled to get up from the awkward pose, but then, the ground chipped
    and his foot slipped. He was now hanging from something that appeared to be Mount Everest. Thump! The beast laid its
    final step and he was now hanging with only one hand. He could not hold anymore, his hand slipped and then-
    I shifted in my seat. “I’m going home, this movie is creeping me out.”
    “Bruhh, it’s only a movie! What's the big deal?”
    What’s the big deal? There’s no way I could make him understand, even if he was my best friend.
    I ran out of the theatre directly to my home where a short story became a long one…
    I slammed the door behind me and leaned my back against it. I took three deep breaths before entering my room and
    turning on netflix. A chill ran down my spine as I saw the 7 red letters appear on the TV screen. What if the same
    movie plays? What would I do? I quickly turned the TV off and turned off the lights. I cuddled inside my bed and
    swiped through TikTok on my phone. What a coincidence! An ad for the same movie played the second I logged on.
    “What a terrible thing to put on an ad,” I thought to myself as I threw my phone hitting my slumberous cat.
    Garfield, however, did not make a single sound as it usually would. As I went over to check my cat, the face was
    nowhere to be found. I looked top to bottom, right to left. I thought it was just hiding its face and looking down
    but how wrong I was. The animal had ghastly pale skin, I didn’t notice this at first, and was now transparent. It
    curled up into a ball with no evidence of being a normal cat.
    “I'm just being delusional, it’s okay,” I assured myself as I put the object-like thing down. However, it just
    floated in the air.
    “Nah, this ain’t happening to me,” I said as I rubbed my eyes. I returned to my bed and tried to sleep. However, my
    eyelids could not bear with the immense light the transparent cat was projecting. The thing was only becoming
    brighter and larger. The intense vibrating hinted that it was about to explode. It then paused and became a still
    figure that was the size of a bear. BAM! The deafening sound of the explosion rang nastily in my eardrums. Then
    everything went black…
    When I woke up, the world was engulfed in darkness. Creatures from outer space have inhabited earth. The land was
    distorted by what seemingly to be ditches created from UFO landings and footprints of eight massive feet have
    created holes.
    “What in the world? Where am I?” I asked myself as I removed the raw flesh that covered me from the explosion.
    “Rest in peace to Garfield,” I prayed for the poor life of the animal.
    I was on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere. Around me, I could see ghostly, distorted trees and abandoned
    decrepit houses. Above me was the stars and galaxy eyes staring down upon me. A lamp-like light caught my vision. It
    was the transparent cat. It began to move towards the south direction. I turned my body and began following it. It
    brought me into a forest where there was a long road. On the two sides of the road stood twisted, gnarled trees that
    sucked up light. The branches were claws, smiling at carnage. I looked down the path and saw a source of light.
    There was no other choice, but to take the terrifying pathway. As I took my first step in, my insecurity flooded me.
    On my two sides, there were endless rows of the faces of wicked trees. I cautiously sneaked along the path scared
    that a spider or some sort of creature would jump up at me. Suddenly, something behind the bushes began whispering
    words:
    “Three! Three! Pun for your knife!
    “He-hello? Is anyone there?” I mumbled hesitantly.
    There was no answer, just the evil stares of the trees.
    “Quick! Fun! The voices muttered again.
    “Fun?” I thought to myself. “What fun is there here?”
    “Yes! fun now!” The voices hissed once again.
    The atmosphere was frantic and disoriented, as I could not figure if I was being delusional again or not. I looked
    in all directions. Behind the trees, to the branches, but I could not find any sign of life. I continued walking
    towards what seemed to be light, trying to work out what the voices were trying to communicate.
    “What was it saying?”
    I asked as I tramped along the path. All of a sudden, the ground shook. I decided to ignore it as I was still in my
    problem solving state.
    “Where did the voices come from?” I analyzed. “Are they trying to communicate or warn me something?”
    And the biggest question of all, over all questions,
    “Where the heck am I??”
    The ground shook again.
    All of a sudden, a thought ran through my mind.
    “The voices weren't saying ‘fun’, ‘three’ or ‘knife’,” I thought. “They were saying run, flee and life! They're
    telling me to run for my life!”
    Behind me, I heard the breaking of tree branches and the swiftness of Tarzan sprinting through a jungle. It was
    approaching closer and closer, until I looked behind me, I was face to face with eyes four times the amount of mine.
    The red, hairy eyes of the creature stared into my soul as it gnashed its perfect two rows of honed teeth in
    massacre. It then began laughing.
    “HAHAHA, what a fool, you’ve fallen into my trap”
    Immediately, I began sprinting through the forest towards the light.
    “Ready or not, here I come!” It said.
    With a sudden shift, the trees on my two sides began to close upon me. The claws of the arm-like branches reached
    over cutting deep slices into the sensitive skin. The bright light in front of me slowly began to disappear as
    cracks appeared below me. One crack after the other, I hopped, avoiding all risks of falling. The honed blades below
    began to appear as the cracks enlarged. This time larger, and much sharper. Tensions were rising, the gap between
    life and death was closing. The giant was only inches away from devouring me.
    “What do I do, what do I do??”
    Thoughts ran through my head like bullets bouncing off concrete. A plan started piecing up in my mind,
    and a lightbulb appeared.
    “This is exactly the scenario in the movie, I already know what happened to the protagonist when he couldn't hold
    his balance and fell inside the crack. If I just avoid the crack, chances will be low for death!”
    A cold chill ran down my spine as risks were high, but I was determined. Then expected, a crack, larger than ever,
    extended in front of me. I know this jump would determine if that gap between life and death enclosed, or enlarged.
    This was the moment of my life. I used all my strength and flew over the spikes that awaited beneath me. However,
    the gap was only getting bigger, and bigger. I failed to make it.
    “AHHH!” I yelled.
    Then, everything went black again. I woke up on the ground to the sound of my friend calling me.
    “You good? You took a pretty hard fall there” he panted and patted the dirt off me.
    I quickly got up.
    “Where am I? Did the spider die?”
    “What spider, what you talkin’ bout?” he asked.
    “The spider! The spider that was about to eat me!” I exaggerated as my friend looked confused as ever.
    “Bro, you delusional, good game though” he said.
    I looked around. I was in the school's forest which was confirmed by the playground beside it. I rubbed my eyes to
    see if it was a dream, and pinched my skin.
    “Ouch!” I yelled as reality was confirmed.
    I noticed I was covered in dirt from the ‘fall’ that happened to me a few moments ago. I patted the dirt and
    observed my surroundings. I felt a tickling sensation and noticed my cat was licking the dirt from my shin. I bent
    down and hugged Garfield.
    “GG’s, cya later” my friend remarked and walked away.
    “yeah... yeah go-good game” I said.
